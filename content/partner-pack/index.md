To celebrate Maintainer Month, we’re spotlighting the people who power open source — and giving back. We’ve teamed up with partners across the ecosystem to offer perks, tools, and resources for maintainers.

Check back throughout May as we add even more!

## How It Works

All offers below are available to any open source maintainer—just follow the links to claim your perk.

Some partners are offering premium perks exclusively for our private Maintainer Community. <a href="https://maintainers.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more & request access</a>.
