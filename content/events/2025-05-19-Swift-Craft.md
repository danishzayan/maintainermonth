Swift Craft is a new Swift developers' conference in the UK. In a theater, set in the coastal cliffs of Folkestone overlooking the English Channel, this is an event with more than just UIViews!

With international experts to engage, educate and entertain us, we put the focus back on the craft of writing Swift code.
