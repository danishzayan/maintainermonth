What happens when open source powers one of the world’s largest digital ecosystems? Join us for a special Open Source Friday livestream from India as Karan M V from GitHub chats with Mr. Vishal Kanvaty, Chief Technology Officer at the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) — the org powering UPI, India’s real-time digital payments platform used by hundreds of millions of people.

In this conversation, we’ll explore:
- How open source technologies are shaping national-scale platforms
- NPCI’s open source journey and governance approach
- Falcon — NPCI’s first open source project
- Insights for developers building for public digital infrastructure

Tune in for a rare, inside look at open source adoption at massive scale — and how developers can play a role in building the future.
