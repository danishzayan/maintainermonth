Many open source maintainers are concerned about their obligations under the EU Cyber Resilience Act. This webinar, organized by the Eclipse Foundation’s Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group, will clarify who is actually affected, what obligations apply, and how to determine if your project falls within the scope of the CRA. We'll cut through the uncertainty and provide practical guidance to help maintainers understand their position. This webinar is streamed by GitHub as part of Maintainer Month.

Key questions this webinar will address:
- Does the CRA apply to my open source project?
- What's the difference between a "manufacturer," "steward," and regular contributor?
- How does accepting donations or sponsorships affect CRA obligations?
- What minimal requirements apply to open source stewards?
- How should maintainers respond to compliance requests from companies?

Guests: 
- Tobie Langel, Technical Lead, Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group
- Felix Reda, Director of Policy, GitHub
- Daniel Stenberg, Founder and lead developer, the cURL project 
- Ashley Williams, Founder and CEO, axo
- Maarten Aertsen, Senior internet technologist, NLnet Labs
