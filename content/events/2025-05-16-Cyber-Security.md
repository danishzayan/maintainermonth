This panel will explore the evolving relationship between open source, cybersecurity, and governance during #MaintainerMonth with GitHub. We are working to bring together voices from the open-source community, startup space, and the public sector.

In alignment with Maintainer Month, the goal is to spark dialogue around collective responsibility, innovation, and sustainability.

**Foster Cross-Sector Dialogue on Collective Responsibility**
Bring together diverse voices from open source, cybersecurity, startups, and public governance to examine our shared roles in creating secure, resilient, and inclusive digital ecosystems.

**Highlight Innovation as a Community Practice**
Showcase how innovation in open source and cybersecurity thrives when it's grounded in collaboration, transparency, and shared stewardship across communities and sectors.

**Center Sustainability for Long-Term Impact**
Explore what sustainable contribution and maintenance look like in open source—financially, socially, and technically—and how we can co-create futures that support maintainers and secure infrastructure.
