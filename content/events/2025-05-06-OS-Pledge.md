The [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) is a group of companies working together to change the status quo in Open Source sustainability. After launching six months ago we have now grown to [34 companies](https://opensourcepledge.com/members/) who have collectively paid maintainers $2,650,212 in the past year. On May 6, the latest companies to join the Pledge will be featured on Nasdaq Tower in Times Square, bringing attention to the need to #paythemaintainers.
