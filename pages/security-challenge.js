üóìÔ∏è Deadline: Submit your form by May 31, 2025 to be eligible for the exam voucher.

### Step 3. Take the Certification Exam!
We'll email you a voucher (valued at $99 USD) to register for the GitHub Advanced Security certification exam in June 2025 after we review all submissions. Successfully passing the exam will earn you an official GitHub certification that showcases your security expertise!

## Why This Matters
Maintainers often carry the responsibility of software security‚Äîbut don't always have access to the right training or recognition. This challenge helps you build real-world skills and gives you an opportunity to earn a GitHub-backed credential that showcases your expertise.

## FAQ
#### Who can participate?
Anyone! While we're celebrating open source maintainers, this challenge is open to all contributors who want to grow their security skills.

#### How long does it take?
Each GitHub Skill takes about 1 hour, so expect to spend around 3 hours total for preparation, plus additional time for the certification exam itself.

#### How many vouchers are available?
Exam vouchers are limited and offered on a first-come, first-served basis. [Submit your form](https://forms.gle/HhPm3VofYDCiXeBB9) by May 31 to qualify!
